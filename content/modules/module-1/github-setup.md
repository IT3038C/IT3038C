Open <https://github.com>

If you already have an account, feel free to use that one. If not, click "Sign up for GitHub".
Create an account using your UC email address and create a username, for example, I will register with <reedws@mail.uc.edu> and username reedws.

If you've never used Github, this is a great opportunity to get familiar with how it works. You can create the initial README.md file to say a little about yourself. Just click the green "Continue" button and start editing.

If you already have a Github.com account, you can create a new Repository with the same name as your username, then create the README.md file within to update your Github homepage.

(Optional step) As students of UC, you can get GitHub Pro for free by visiting this link: <https://education.github.com/pack>
