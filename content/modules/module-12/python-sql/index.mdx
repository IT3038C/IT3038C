## Learning outcomes
1. Practice the use of Git and GitHub.
2. Practice the use of Python to run commands.
3. Practice the use of Python to interact with files.

## Goals
This is a collection of Python exercises and coding challenges. The focus in this assignment is to:
- Practice problem solving.
- Practice Python fundamentals.
- Practice using the official documentation

## Guidelines
* This assignment utilized automated-tests to check for the correctness of your code. These tests can be a bit specific about what you name things
  * Please Follow the instructions on this assignment for the best outcome.
* Make a habit of committing and pushing your code frequently to GitHub.
* Make sure to meaningful commit messages that describe what you did.
* Make sure the automated tests and checks continue to pass after you make changes.
* To be able to run the automated grading checks, make sure you have installed Python 3
* **Don't forget to fill out the self assessment on the README file**

## Instructions
1. Accept the Assignment on Canvas.
  * This will create a repository for you with a few starting files.
    ```
      .
      ├── .vscode
      │   └── settings.json
      ├── e1_sqlite.py               ⬅️
      ├── e2_pandas.py               ⬅️
      ├── test_e1_sqlite.py
      ├── test_e2_pandas.py
      ├── test_regex.py
      ├── .gitignore
      ├── requirements.txt
      └── README.md                  🔼: update this once done
    ```
  * You will only be working on the files marked with the arrows
2. Clone down the repository to your local computer.
3. Install the project dependencies using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
  * Make sure you're in the project directory in the terminal before you run this command.
4. Run the project tests using the command `pytest`
  The starter code has invalid syntax so the tests will fail to run

5. Our task would be to implement the functions in the files marked with ⬅️ arrow above until all the tests pass.
6. at the end of each test, commit your code <img alt="commit logo" style={{height:`20px`, marginBottom:`-4px`}} src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Octicons-git-commit.svg/1200px-Octicons-git-commit.svg.png"/> `git commit -m "finished test xyz"`.

7. **DON'T FORGET** to Update the README.md file with your self assessment
    * Your grade
    * Self Reflection
    * How long it took you to complete the assignment
8. Push your code.
