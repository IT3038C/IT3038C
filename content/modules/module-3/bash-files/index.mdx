## Guidelines
* This assignment utilized automated-tests to check for the correctness of your code. These tests can be a bit specific about what you name things
  * Please follow the instructions on this assignment for the best outcome.
* Make a habit of committing and pushing your code frequently to GitHub.
* Make sure to meaningful commit messages that describe what you did.
* Make sure the automated tests and checks continue to pass after you make changes.
* **Don't forget to fill out the self assessment on the README file**

## Instructions
1. Accept the Assignment on Canvas.
  * This will create a repository for you with a few starting files.
    ```
      .
      ├── .vscode
      │   └── settings.json
      ├── 1-directory-listing.sh    ⬅️
      ├── 2-backup-file.sh          ⬅️
      ├── 3-backup-directory.sh     ⬅️
      ├── test_backup-file.sh
      ├── test_backup-directory.sh
      ├── test_directory-listing.sh
      └── README.md                 🔼: update this once done
    ```
  * You will only be working on the files marked with the arrows
2. Clone down the repository to your linux VM.
4. Run the project tests by running each test script with bash.
5. Our task would be to implement the functions in the files marked with ⬅️ arrow above until all the tests pass.
6. At the end of each test, commit your code <img alt="commit logo" style={{height:`20px`, marginBottom:`-4px`}} src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Octicons-git-commit.svg/1200px-Octicons-git-commit.svg.png"/> `git commit -m "finished test xyz"`.

7. **DON'T FORGET** to Update the README.md file with your self assessment
    * Your grade
    * Self Reflection
    * How long it took you to complete the assignment
8. Push your code.
